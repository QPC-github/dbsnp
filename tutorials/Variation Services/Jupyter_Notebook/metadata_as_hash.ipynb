In the second tutorial, we present Python functions to transform the metadata about studies into dictionaries indexed by their bioproject ids. The populations associated with each study are in turn indexed by their biosample ids. This initial transformation preserves the hierarchical structure of the studies and their populations. Finally, the third tutorial presents a way to index populations by their biosample ids but using a flatter structure than the original."
